Throughout the preparation of our end-of-year project, we wanted to tackle the graph creation problem using a clear methodology. From evaluating the different strategies and implementations until we eventually build an intelligent model that can predict the best creation strategy.
\\
\\
We started by specifying the context and by modelling our problem mathematically in order to have a clear vision on what we want to build.
\\
\\
In chapter 2, We presented our design and the different design principles we followed in order to ensure the flexibility and resiliency of our work product.
\\
\\
In chapter 3, we presented the different tools used and our general process, in addition to the different challenges we faced while building the Monitoring software that was used later to generate inputs to be used the machine learning phase.
\\
\\
In chapter 4, we analyzed the different results we gathered after we run the software on multiple machines. Which helped later on while building the machine learning pipeline.
\\
\\
And finally, we presented our machine learning methodology, explained in details its different steps and presented the results to get a working intelligent system for graph creation.
